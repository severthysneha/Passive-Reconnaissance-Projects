##DNS Enumeration
**This folder contains DNS enumeration work using Whois, Censys and Maltego.
##Tools Used
Whois â†’ Domain details, Registrar info, Name servers, Registrant/technical contact info
Censys â†’ host, service, software, port, ASN, location, and technology fingerprinting data, IP addresses of the discovered hosts along with metadata

 ðŸ“Œ Observations
 The domain openai.com is registered with MarkMonitor Inc., a well-known registrar for large organizations.
 The domain has been active since 2007 and is renewed until 2029 â†’ shows long-term ownership.
 DNS servers are hosted on Azure DNS â†’ indicates Microsoft cloud infrastructure usage.
Domain status is set to client/server delete/transfer/update prohibited â†’ strong protections enabled at the registrar level.
DNSSEC is not enabled â†’ this could leave the domain vulnerable to DNS spoofing.
 Publicly visible WHOIS contact details are protected (emails hidden behind MarkMonitorâ€™s web form).
 From Censys search, infrastructure/services linked to the domain were found, useful for attacker mapping.
 ðŸ“Œ Attack
 Identify the DNS provider and try targeted social engineering.
 Track domain expiry for potential hijacking.
 Map infrastructure (Azure DNS in this case) for further reconnaissance.
 **Note: This was gathered using only passive reconnaissance techniques (WHOIS lookups & Censys search).
 ðŸ“Œ Exploit
 **Possible exploitation paths (theoretical, not performed here):
 DNS Hijacking â†’ If attackers compromise registrar or DNS account.
 Phishing / Spoofing â†’ Using domain similarity or misconfigured subdomains.
 Domain Takeover â†’ If domain renewal is missed.
 ðŸ“Œ Mitigation
 Enable DNSSEC to prevent DNS spoofing.
